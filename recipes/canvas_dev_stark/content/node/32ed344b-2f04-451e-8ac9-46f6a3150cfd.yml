      value: '<p>Product teams now have unlimited raw material: summaries, feature explanations, and launch copy generated in seconds. The challenge is not writing more; it is choosing the story people can actually repeat.</p><p>We usually begin with customer tension, not feature inventory. Start by naming what is frustrating today, then show how the product changes that moment in concrete terms.</p><p>If you need inspiration, collect a handful of support tickets and sales call quotes, and map them into one narrative arc. A strong narrative is easier to brief internally, easier to localize, and easier to adapt for <a href="#">release notes</a>.</p><h2>Build stories around outcomes</h2><p>Outcome-centered messaging keeps teams aligned when launch pressure increases.</p><ul><li>Describe the user problem in plain language.</li><li>State the product change that resolves the problem.</li><li>Explain the measurable result the user can expect.</li></ul><h3>Drafting checklist for launch teams</h3><p>Use this sequence when converting rough model output into launch-ready communication.</p><ol><li>Identify one audience and one primary job to be done.</li><li>Cut all claims that are not supported by product behavior.</li><li>Rewrite for voice consistency and scanning readability.</li><li>Validate copy with product, design, and support leads.</li></ol><blockquote><p>“Features explain what changed.
