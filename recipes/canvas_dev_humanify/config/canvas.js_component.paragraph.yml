      - "Something magical happens when humans make things. Depth, nuance,
        creativity, and original ideas appear in the work."
      - "We pretend to hallucinate as much as necessary to ease the transition
        to working with humans again, but we never let that slip into our final
        deliverables."
      - "If you're confused about what that means, just replace the word
        <em>value</em> with <em>tokens</em>. It doesn't make it less confusing,
        but we all came to accept it, didn't we?"
