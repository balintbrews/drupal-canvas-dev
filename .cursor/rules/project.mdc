# Project

## Overview

The goal of the project is to develop Drupal Canvas, a new Drupal module with a
React UI for visual site building.

Drupal Canvas enables site builders without Drupal experience to easily theme
and build their entire website using only their browser, without the need to
write code beyond basic JSX and CSS. With Drupal Canvas, content creators are
able to compose content on any part of the page without relying on developers.

## Codebase

The codebase contains not only the code for Drupal Canvas, but also an entire
Drupal website and environment set up to develop Drupal Canvas.

**Important:** By default, work with files in `web/modules/contrib/canvas`, the
Drupal Canvas codebase.

The codebase is structured as follows:

1. **Root:**: Drupal website installation managed with DDEV. This is the
   development environment, and it lives in a separate repository from Drupal
   Canvas.
2. **`web/modules/contrib/canvas`**: The Drupal Canvas module and its code
   repository. This directory contains all the Drupal backend (PHP) code, as
   well as other packages which are mentioned in this list separately.
3. **`web/modules/contrib/canvas/ui`**: Codebase for the Drupal Canvas module's
   UI. Key technologies: React 18, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Vite, Radix UI,
   and Radix Themes.
4. **`web/modules/contrib/canvas/cli`**: Codebase for a CLI tool written in
   Node.js. The CLI tool is a client for managing Drupal Canvas code components,
   which are built with standard React and JavaScript.
