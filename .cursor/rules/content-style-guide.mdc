# Content style guide

Follow this style guide when writing documentation, Cursor rules, inline code
comments, and UI copy.

- Be concise and avoid verbose phrasing.
- Use sentence casing for all titles, headings, button labels, documentation,
  and Cursor rules.
- Always use Oxford commas in lists.
- For other stylistic choices, follow AP Style.
- Don't use emojis, unless they clearly help with understanding.
- Avoid unnecessary adjectives and marketing language, e.g. sophisticated,
  elegant, powerful, robust, seamless, intuitive, cutting-edge, revolutionary,
  amazing, etc. Focus on concrete functionality and specific benefits rather
  than subjective descriptors.
