# Running automated tests to verify your work

The following instructions will refer to different parts of the codebase. See
[`project.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/project.mdc) for details on the codebase
structure.

When it comes to running tests, you can ignore what's described in
[`project.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/project.mdc) as "Root". There are no tests to
run there. The other parts listed there are relevant.

Whenever you make changes, identify which part of the project you are in, and
run the relevant tests according to the followings.

## UI: `web/modules/contrib/canvas/ui`

### Vitest

Always see if there are tests written in Vitest to verify your changes. Most of
the Vitest tests are co-located with the implementation.

Look for files that end with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx`. These are Vitest files.
Always run the relevant ones for your changes.

E.g. if you updated the file `src/features/code-editor/hooks/useCodeEditor.ts`,
see if there is a file named
`src/features/code-editor/hooks/useCodeEditor.test.ts`. If found, run the tests
as follows:

```
ddev n run test -- [path]
```

Pass the path to the test file relative to the UI folder. So, e.g.,
`web/modules/contrib/canvas/ui/src/features/code-editor/hooks/useCodeEditor.test.tsx`
should be passed as `src/features/code-editor/hooks/useCodeEditor.test.tsx`.
E.g.:

```
ddev n run test -- src/features/code-editor/hooks/useCodeEditor.test.tsx
```

When you're done with specific changes, and all the individual tests are
passing, always run the entire Vitest test suite:

```
ddev n run test
```

### Cypress component tests

Certain features in the UI codebase are covered by Cypress component tests found
in the directory `web/modules/contrib/canvas/ui/tests/unit`.

Identify whenever your changes are covered by any of these tests. If so, run
them as follows:

```
ddev cy --component --spec [path]
```

Pass the path to the test file relative to the UI folder. So, e.g.,
`web/modules/contrib/canvas/ui/tests/unit/undo-redo-timeline.cy.js` should be
passed as `tests/unit/undo-redo-timeline.cy.js`. E.g.:

```
ddev cy --component --spec tests/unit/undo-redo-timeline.cy.js
```

Never run the entire Cypress component test suite.

### Cypress end-to-end tests

Never run Cypress end-to-end tests.

## Playwright end-to-end tests: `web/modules/contrib/canvas/tests`

The project has end-to-end tests written in Playwright. Identify whenever your
changes are covered by any of these tests. If so, run them as follows:

```
ddev playwright --spec [path]
```

Pass the path to the test file relative to the UI folder. So, e.g.,
`web/modules/contrib/canvas/tests/src/Playwright/navigationUndoRedo.spec.ts`
should be passed as `tests/src/Playwright/navigationUndoRedo.spec.ts`. E.g.:

```
ddev playwright --spec tests/src/Playwright/navigationUndoRedo.spec.ts
```

## Backend: `web/modules/contrib/canvas`

Instructions to be added. In the meantime, do not run tests, or ask.

## CLI: `web/modules/contrib/canvas/cli`

Instructions to be added. In the meantime, do not run tests, or ask.
