# Coding style guide

## Inline code comments

Never remove existing inline comments when you make changes to existing code.

Always end inline comments with a period. E.g.:

```
// Create a new hook with a different route.
```

Avoid adding inline code comments unless they explain complex logic or
non-obvious decisions. Do not add comments that merely restate what the code
does. E.g., do NOT add a comment like this:

```
// Reset the spy.
dispatchSpy.mockClear();
```

The code already says that that's what's happening. A good comment for the same
piece of code would be:

```
// Ensure that previous calls are not counted in later assertions.
dispatchSpy.mockClear();
```

This comment gives additional context, and explains why the code is there, as
opposed to what the code does.

When you add inline comments, prefer:

- phrasing them as proper sentences with punctuation;
- adding them in their own line.

You can deviate from this if it helps with understanding.
